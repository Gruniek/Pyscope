PYSCOPE
=======

A Stellarium compatible telescope control server module written in Python

Details
=======

A simple server that is compatible with the Stellarium (http://www.stellarium.org)
telescope control protocol.
The main purpose of Pyscope is to allow users to interface with Stellarium and use 
the coordinate data as they choose.
Perhaps you need to control your own custom telescope control rig, 
or you need to create an interface for an as yet unsupported mount.

This module should hopefully make these tasks a bit easier.
